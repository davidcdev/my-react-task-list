# Productive Day: A todo list web app built with React

Here's the link to the project: [Productive Day](https://productive-day.netlify.app)

## Overview
This app was built with **React** using **Vite** implementing **reusable components**, **React Hooks** like **useState** and **useEffect**, **libraries**, and also **Custom Hooks** to separate the logic and clean up the component files.

This project has different pages, for that I implemented **React Router** and **Lazy Loading** following the documentation.

For the notifications, I used **React Hot Toast** which I think is a really good-looking library.

To improve the UI I have used **Chakra UI** which makes it so easy to implement dark mode as well.

I have used **Simple Icons** as well and I think they look really good and are easy to use.

The app also has **persistence** by using the local storage of the browser, which means if you close the tab or the browser, your task list will stay the same as before closing the app.

## Pages

I love minimal and clean designs, there are three pages on the app, *Home*, *Tasks*, and *About Us*, before checking each one, on the top there is the navbar with the menu and also an icon that links to my GitHub and the icon to switch to dark mode.

### Home
On the home page, you will see a greeting to the app and a report of how many pending and completed tasks you do have on your list.

### Tasks
On the tasks page, you have the inputs to enter a title for the new task, which is required, and also a description, you can add it by clicking on the Add button or with the Intro key as well.

For each action, there's a notification, and the list is made out of cards for each task that will change it's appearance when marking them as completed and will disappear when you delete them.

### About Us
The about page is a little description of the purpose of the app and has some cards with tips on how to use it.

## Demo
